# Exercise: Binomial class

extend the distributions package with a new class called `Binomial`.

Inside the folder called 4a_binomial_package, there is another folder and these files:

- distributions, which contains the code for the distributions package including Gaussiandistribution.py and Generaldistribution.py code.

- setup.py, a file needed for building Python packages with pip.

- test.py unit tests to help you debug your code.

- numbers.txt and numbers_binomial.txt, which are data files used as part of the unit tests.

- Binomialdistribution.py and Binomialdistribution_challenge.py. Choose one of these files for completing the exercise. Binomialdistribution.py includes more of the code already set up for you. In Binomialdistribution_challenge.py, you'll have to write all of the code from scratch. Both files contain instructions with TODOS to fill out.
