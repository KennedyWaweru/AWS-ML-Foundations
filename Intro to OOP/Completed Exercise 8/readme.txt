TODO: Convert modularized code into a python package

create a folder called 3a_python_package. 

Inside this folder, you need to create a few folders and files:

- A setup.py file, which is required in order to use pip install.

- A subfolder called distributions, which is the name of the Python package.

- Inside the distributions folder, you need:

 - The Gaussiandistribution.py file (provided).
 - The Generaldistribution.py file (provided).
 - The __init__.py file (you need to create this file).

Set up a virtual environment first.
